This is the repository for the first challenge of bootcamp.

The aim of this challenge was to take an existing website and clean it up without changing the function or form of the website. 

The website itself was simple, but the code carried a lot of the redundencies, especially within the css file.
I fixed the following:
  - Consolidated a lot of the classes and ids, trimming down the code quite a bit
  - Fixed one of the subheaders in the top, allowing it to take you down the page like the others in the main header
  - Added a proper title to the webpage
  - Gave alt descriptions of all of the images
  - Added descriptive comments throughout the html and css files
  - Made the 'h2' in the footer into a 'h4'
  - Changed around the order of the elements of the css file. Not necessary, but it follows a more logical order now
